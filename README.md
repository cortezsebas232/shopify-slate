### Iâ€™m a theme developer that is using Slate. What should I do now?

Slate was built upon [Theme Kit](https://github.com/Shopify/themekit) as an opinionated way to setup up a Shopify theme build. Shopify will continue to actively maintain and support the growth of Theme Kit through the open-source community.

You can continue using Slate the way you have been. While we will not be maintaining it any longer, you can still fork the repo to suit your own needs.

<hr />

> **Slate v1.0 is currently in beta.** Expect more bugs than a final release. If you are migrating from using the previous version of Slate, please review the [new documentation](https://shopify.github.io/slate/docs/about) as there are breaking changes. Slate v1.0 has not yet been tested on Windows.

Slate empowers developers of all skill levels to build quality Shopify themes. Slate guides developers by providing a tested workflow and opinionated development toolkit, while also accommodating more established developers through advanced configuration.
