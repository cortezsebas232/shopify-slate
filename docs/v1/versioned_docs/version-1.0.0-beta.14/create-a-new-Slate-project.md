Creating a new Slate project is as simple as running a single command. We recommend using either [`yarn create`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) or [`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) to create a new Slate project:

```bash
yarn create slate-theme my-new-theme
```

or

```bash
npx create-slate-theme my-new-theme
```

> **Note**: The default Slate theme is generated from [`Shopify/starter-theme`](https://github.com/Shopify/starter-theme); Shopify's opinionated starting point for developing Shopify themes. However, you're not forced to create a new project with Shopify's own starting point. See [custom starter themes](starter-themes#custom-starter-themes) for more information on how you can generate a new project from other sources or contributing your own to the community!
