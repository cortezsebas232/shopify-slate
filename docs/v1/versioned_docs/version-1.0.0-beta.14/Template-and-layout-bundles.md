Template and layout bundles are a build-time optimization which ensures that only the JS and CSS needed for the current page is downloaded and executed. This optimization results in improved page load speed, especially on mobile devices with limited computing power and network capacity.

## Project file structure

In order to take advantage of template and layout bundles, your Slate project's `script/` folder must include the following folders:

```bash
└── src
   └── scripts
   │   ├── layout
   │   └── templates
   ├── layout
   └── templates
```

On build, Slate will look for each file in the `scripts/layout` and `scripts/templates` folders and see if there is a matching file in the `src/layout` and `src/templates` folders. If there is a match, a template or layout bundle is created for that match.

Let's take a look at an example file structure and explore how Slate matches files to create bundles:

```bash
└── src
   └── scripts
   │   ├── layout
   │   │   ├── password.js
   │   │   └── theme.js
   │   └── templates
   │       ├── index.js
   │       └── product.js
   ├── layout
   │   └── theme.liquid
   └── templates
       ├── collection.liquid
       ├── index.liquid
       └── product.liquid
```

In the example above, we have a few standard files and folders you might expect to find in a Slate project. We have our main layout file (`theme.liquid`), three template files (`collection.liquid`, `index.liquid`, and `product.liquid`), and various JS files within our `scripts/` folder.

Upon calling `slate-tools build`, Slate will look for matching template and layout files inside the `scripts/` folder and generate the following JS bundles:

- `layout.theme.js`: Both `theme.liquid` and `theme.js` exist.
- `template.index.js`: Both `index.liquid` and `index.js` exist.
- `template.product.js`: Both `product.liquid` and `product.js` exist.

Note that the following bundles **are not** generated:

- `layout.password.js`: Slate cannot find a `layout/password.liquid` file.
- `template.collection.js`: Slate cannot find a `scripts/templates/collection.js` file.

## Shared JS dependencies chunking

A critical optimization needed for template and layout bundles to be successful is to split shared dependencies between bundles into separate chunks. This reduces the amount of duplicate code included in each bundle and further improves page load performance.

Let's continue with the file structure from the previous example, and see how shared dependencies are separated:

_index.js_

```js
@import depA from 'depA';
@import depB from 'depB';
```

_product.js_

```js
@import depB from 'depB';
@import depC from 'depC';
```

In the example above, we have 2 files which each import 2 dependencies. Both files have a shared dependency, `depB`. Instead of bundling `depB` into `template.index.js` and again in `template.product.js`, Slate splits `depB` into its own bundle chunk. The resulting generated files are:

- `template.index.js`: Code that is only used on the index template.
- `template.product.js`: Code that is only used on the product template.
- `template.index@template.product.js`: Code that is used on both index and product templates.

## Template and layout styles

It's also possible to structure your styles so that only those needed for the current page are loaded. This is made possible by the JS bundling mentioned above. Let's take a look at what a typical Slate project might look like and how it would take advantage of template and layout styles.

_layout/theme.js_

```js
import '../../styles/layout/theme.scss';
```

_product.js_

```js
import '../../styles/templates/product.scss';
```

Looking at the above examples, we can see that we are importing two different SCSS files. We can expect that `theme.scss` contains global styles that are used through most of the theme's pages, such as header and navigation styles. `product.scss` might include styles that are specific to the product template, such as a product image gallery.

The following imports would generate the following files:

- layout.theme.css.liquid
- template.product.css.liquid

> Unlike JS, we are unable to split shared dependencies between template and layout styles. If you're not careful, this could mean that your users will end up downloading the same styles more than once. Make sure to keep this in mind!

## Including generated bundles in your theme

Now that you have template and layout bundles with shared dependency chunking, you'll notice that there are a lot of JS files in your compiled Slate project (found in the `dist` folder). It would be pretty tedious to code and manage all the `<script>` tags for each of these assets. So let's have Slate handle this!

Slate generates `script-tags.liquid` and `styles-tags.liquid` snippets which include `<script>` and `<link>` tags needed for each bundle. These snippets also include all the liquid logic needed to selectively load these bundles based on the current template and layout. All you need to do is include these snippets in your layout files.

For example, here is what you would include in your `layout/theme.liquid`:

```html
{% include 'style-tags' %} {% include 'script-tags', layout: 'theme' %}
```

where the `layout` option value is the name of the layout.
