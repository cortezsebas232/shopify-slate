Now that you have a new Slate project, you need to link it to your [remote Shopify store](how-to-create-a-development-store) by updating the [`.env` file](https://github.com/Shopify/slate/blob/master/packages/slate-env/README.md) with your API credentials.

## Example `.env` file

```bash
# The myshopify.com URL to your Shopify store
SLATE_STORE={store-name}.myshopify.com

# The API password generated from a Private App
SLATE_PASSWORD=ccf7fb19ed4dc6993ac6355c0c489c7c7

# The ID of the theme you wish to upload files to
SLATE_THEME_ID=32112656003

# A list of file patterns to ignore, with each list item separated by ':' (optional)
SLATE_IGNORE_FILES=config/settings_data.json

# The timeout for upload theme (optional)
SLATE_TIMEOUT=2m
```

## Setting SLATE_STORE

This refers to the URL of your Shopify store, e.g. store-name.myshopify.com.

> Note: the `https://` protocol is not included and neither is the trailing slash.

## Setting SLATE_PASSWORD

Create a new private app by navigating to your store’s private apps page _https://{store-name}.myshopify.com/admin/apps/private_, giving the private app a name and setting the **Theme templates and theme assets** to “Read and write”.

Hit the “Save” button, edit the new private app and click “Show” to view the **Password** field. This is your `SLATE_PASSWORD`.

## Setting SLATE_THEME_ID

You can view a full list of all available theme IDs for your store by navigating to _https://{store-name}.myshopify.com/admin/themes.xml_.

Each theme entry will have an `id` tag. Set the `SLATE_THEME_ID` to the theme ID you want to deploy to.

> Note: When you deploy your theme, Slate will overwrite the existing remote code associated with the `SLATE_THEME_ID` you defined with your local project’s code, which you may not want. To avoid this, navigate to _https://{store-name}.myshopify.com/admin/themes_ and duplicate an existing theme ID to work from.

## Setting SLATE_IGNORE_FILES

This setting enables you to ignore certain files from being deployed to your Shopify store. One example would be to ignore the `settings_data.json` file to avoid overwriting your theme’s section settings every time you deploy your theme.

The file paths are relative to the theme’s `dist/` directory so ignoring the `settings_data.json` file would look like the following:

```bash
SLATE_IGNORE_FILES=config/settings_data.json
```

## Setting SLATE_TIMEOUT

Request timeout. If you have larger files in your project that may take longer than the default 30s to upload, you may want to increase this value. You can set this value to 60s for seconds or 1m for one minute. [Themekit request timeout configuration](https://github.com/Shopify/themekit/blob/master/docs/configuration/index.md#theme-kit-configuration)

```bash
SLATE_TIMEOUT=2m
```

## Creating an alternative `.env` file

Slate allows you to define multiple environment files. Users can specify the `--env` flag with slate-tools scripts to use with an `.env.{env}` file. For example:

```bash
yarn start --env=production
```

will look for a `.env.production` file.
